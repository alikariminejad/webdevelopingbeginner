    <h1>Welcome to your First Exercise!</h1>
    <p>For this exercise we will be creating a weight metric converter</p>
    <p>We will take in a number in pounds (lbs) and convert it to kilograms (kg).
    </p>
    <p>To complete this exercise do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Link this HTML file (2-exercise.html) to you own .js file</li>
      <li>Use Javascript to accept a number input in pounds (lbs)</li>
      <li>Then in your js file convert this number to kilograms (* 0.454)</li>
      <li>Afterwards report back in an alert what the weight is in kg</li>
      <li>Then log/write "Conversion Completed" to the console</li>
    </ul>
